Custom PowerShell Launcher for OSDCloud (https://www.osdcloud.com/) as decribed on my blog (https://mikemdm.de/2023/09/10/modern-os-provisioning-for-windows-autopilot-using-osdcloud/)

All scripts are provided "AS IS" with no liability and should always be tested in a test environment before used in production!
