# OSDCloudCustomBuilder Module Refactoring Documentation

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to the OSDCloudCustomBuilder module to improve its quality, maintainability, and error handling.

## Deprecated Scripts

The following scripts have been moved to the `Scripts/Deprecated` folder as they are no longer directly used in the module:

1. **Mutex-CriticalSection.ps1**
   - Replaced by more robust locking mechanisms in the updated module
   - Functionality integrated into `Invoke-WithRetry.ps1` with better error handling
   - The new implementation provides better thread safety and resource management

2. **New-WorkspaceDirectory.ps1**
   - Functionality integrated into `Initialize-BuildEnvironment.ps1`
   - The new implementation provides better error handling and logging
   - Directory creation is now part of a more comprehensive environment setup process

3. **Remove-TempFiles.ps1**
   - Functionality integrated into more comprehensive cleanup routines
   - Each function now handles its own cleanup with proper error handling
   - Temporary file management is now more consistent across the module

4. **Test-WimFile.ps1**
   - Functionality integrated into `Copy-CustomWimToWorkspace.ps1` with better error handling
   - WIM file validation is now performed as part of the copy operation
   - This reduces redundant file operations and improves performance

## Script Replacements

| Old Script | New Script | Improvements |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| Mutex-CriticalSection.ps1 | Invoke-WithRetry.ps1 | Better error handling, retry logic, and resource management |
| New-WorkspaceDirectory.ps1 | Initialize-BuildEnvironment.ps1 | Comprehensive environment setup with validation and logging |
| Remove-TempFiles.ps1 | *Integrated into individual functions* | Function-specific cleanup with proper error handling |
| Test-WimFile.ps1 | Copy-CustomWimToWorkspace.ps1 | Combined validation and copy operations for better performance |

## Functionality Migration Details

### Mutex-CriticalSection.ps1 to Invoke-WithRetry.ps1

The critical section functionality has been enhanced and integrated into the `Invoke-WithRetry.ps1` script, which provides:

- Retry logic with configurable attempts and delays
- Proper resource cleanup even in error conditions
- Enhanced logging of lock acquisition and release
- Thread safety improvements for parallel operations

### New-WorkspaceDirectory.ps1 to Initialize-BuildEnvironment.ps1

Workspace directory creation is now part of the comprehensive environment initialization process:

- Validates disk space before creating directories
- Creates all required subdirectories in a single operation
- Provides detailed logging of the initialization process
- Handles permission issues and other common errors

### Remove-TempFiles.ps1 Integration

Temporary file cleanup has been integrated into each function that creates temporary files:

- Each function is responsible for cleaning up its own temporary files
- Cleanup operations are wrapped in try/finally blocks to ensure execution
- Logging of cleanup operations for better diagnostics
- Support for the -SkipCleanup parameter across all functions

### Test-WimFile.ps1 to Copy-CustomWimToWorkspace.ps1

WIM file validation is now performed as part of the copy operation:

- Validates the WIM file before copying to avoid wasting time on invalid files
- Checks file integrity during and after the copy operation
- Provides detailed error messages for different validation failures
- Supports both standard and optimized copy methods (robocopy)

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common functionality is now centralized
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch blocks with detailed error messages
3. **Better Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of resources even in error conditions
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed logging throughout the module for better diagnostics
5. **Improved Performance**: Optimized operations with reduced redundancy
6. **Better Maintainability**: More modular code with clear separation of concerns
